# Software Design and Architecture Week11 FAQs

# Assessment Resources
The assessment brief and copies of the lecture slides are available on **Moodle**.

All labs, lab solutions and code examples are available from the [Student Git Repo](https://github.com/SBakerMmu/6G5Z0059-2526-student)

The notes that go with the lectures are in the [Software Design and Architecture Textbook](https://github.com/SBakerMmu/6G5Z0059-2526-student/wiki).

If you are stuck getting started with the assessment task components, there are two projects in the Student Git Repo to help: 

- **1CWK100Game** contains some hints and stater code about writing the game logic
- **1CWK100Architecture** contains a starter project for a Clean Architecture implementation of your game

A Standard Markdown tutorial on Markdown is available from [commonmark.org](https://commonmark.org/help/).

A Jetbrains tutorial on how to create a Markdown file in IntelliJ is available at [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html)

For advanced Markdown features, see GitHub Flavour Markdown at [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github).

# FAQs
## User Interface
There is no need to write a UI (either graphical or command line). The only UI that is required is a bit of console application to ask which game the user wants to replay (if you are attempting the advanced feature to replay a game).

It is perfectly fine to run one game after another, but ideally your code will output a clear start and end of the game (so it is obvious where one game ends and other one starts) and the configuration that was used (for example, the output in the Appendix of the assessment brief shows a presentation of the game configuration).

## Do I need to show all possible combinations of variations
No, there are a large number of combinations of variations, but it is only necessary to demonstrate each variation once.

- Show your 1 and 2 dice variations using random dice
- It is much easier to develop and demonstrate the game features such as the END rules using a sequence of dice rolls.
 
## The game can get stuck with Exact End rules and 2 dice, because the minimum value of 2 dice is 2.

- If using random dice you will need to put some sort of check around the game to terminate it if the number of turns exceeds some sensible number.
- If you use fixed dice sequences then you can demonstrate Exact End rules, carefully choosing your dice sequences to avoid the problem. 

## Can I submit my code via GitHub
No, the University requires that you submit via Moodle, because this is how we know if you have met the submission deadline or not.

Your submission should be in the form of a ZIP file containing:
- The complete source code for your submission as an IntelliJ project.
- A readme file written in Markdown.

- Please name your submission file as 
Firstname_Lastname_StudentIDNumber.zip (Example: Steve_Williams_12345678.zip).

Moodle submission inboxes cannot accept files larger than 100 MB. It is unlikely that you will exceed this for this assessment. 

Should you need to submit files exceeding this size you are required to upload your project to your university-supplied OneDrive account and submit a link as part of the package you submit to Moodle (e.g., pasted into a text file). 

Prior to submission via Moodle, please ensure that you archive your project folders into a zip file and upload them to your OneDrive account.

If submitting via OneDrive, ensure that your tutors `steve.baker@mmu.ac.uk` and `ashley.williams@mmu.ac.uk` have access to the work. **Do not** alter your work after the deadline.   

*We are trialling submission by GitHub in another module and may do this for the next cohort*
